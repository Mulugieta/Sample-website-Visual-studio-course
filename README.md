Favorite Song Webpage
This is a simple website I made to show one of my favorite songs.

Whatâ€™s in this website?
A basic webpage with a title

An embedded YouTube music video

Some colors and fonts changed with CSS

A small box that moves side to side using JavaScript animation

How to view it
Open the index.html file in any web browser.

You will see the video and the animated box.

How I made it
Used HTML to build the page structure

Used CSS to style text and background

Used JavaScript to create a moving animation

Tools I used
Visual Studio to write the code

Git and GitHub to save and share the project
